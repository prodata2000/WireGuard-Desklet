## Configuring `wg-quick` without a Password Prompt

To allow `wg-quick` to run without prompting for a password, you'll need to modify the sudoers file.

1. Open a terminal and type `sudo visudo` to edit the sudoers file.
2. Add the following line at the end of the file (replace `yourusername` with your actual username):

   ```bash
   yourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wg-quick
   ```

3. Save the file and exit. This will allow the `wg-quick` command to run without a password prompt for the specified user.

**⚠️ Warning:** Modifying the sudoers file can be risky. Always make sure you know what you're doing and understand the implications. Giving NOPASSWD access can be a security risk if not managed carefully.

## Usage

Once installed, the desklet will show on your desktop. Click on it to toggle the WireGuard connection. Use the settings menu (right-click on the desklet and choose 'Configure') to add, delete, or switch WireGuard interfaces and to read instructions.
